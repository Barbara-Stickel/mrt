MRT
===

A graphical tool for modeling the spatial resolution of mean radiant temperature within a space.

Running it
----------

Open `index.html` in a nice browser. As long as it's up-to-date and has WebGL there should be nothing to install.

Features
--------

1. Visualize the MRT on a plane within a shoebox model of a space
2. Add radiant panels (one per surface)
3. Dynamically change shoebox or panel geometry
4. Change occupant posture and azimuth
